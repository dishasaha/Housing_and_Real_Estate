# Housing_and_Real_Estate
First project for DSC680 Applied Data Science 

The domain of this project will highlight and explore housing and real estate within the United States. I will specifically focus on what potential factors could be impacting the price of a house. I found the following articles to aid in my research.

I will be using multiple linear regression to create a model to forecast real estate prices based on location and interest rates and other correlated factors. Then I will forecast 2021 real estate prices to find the difference in price to see how real estate prices have been impacted from other unique factors such as lower inventory and lumber shortages. This will be useful by being able to see where real estate prices may end up in the future once all the near term effects have been removed.
